       <div id="collapseSC1" class="accordion-body collapse">
          <p>Enter keywords into the search box located at the top of the page. ScholarSphere searches on metadata (description) for content that has been made public. Full-text searching of content in an uploaded file is not available but is an enhancement planned for a future release.           </p>

       <i class="icon-chevron-right"></i></a>
       <div id="collapseSC2" class="accordion-body collapse">
          <p>The default parameter for searching is by "AND." If you enter two words in the search box, it searches on both of the words. An example is data curation: all results returned for this search will contain both words, but not necessarily adjacent to each other. Results might include both data curation appearing in one result, and digital curation appearing in another, with the word data appearing somewhere else in the result.

To search by either word, use the term "OR" in your search. For example, results from a search for data OR curation will contain either the word data, or the word curation somewhere in the results, and might also contain both words, though not necessarily adjacent to each other. This type of searching is likely to bring back more results - it is a broader approach to searching.

To search by a specific phrase, put quotation marks around the phrase. A search for "data curation" will return results in which the two words are adjacent to each other and in the specified order.

            Choosing a Creative Commons license will make it clear to anyone exactly what rights you have given for re-use of your work. Creative Commons is a non-profit organization dedicated to making the sharing and distribution of knowledge and creativity as uncomplicated and barrier-free as possible. It accomplishes this through various licenses, which people are free to apply to their creations as they wish.
            </p><p>
            These licenses range from somewhat restrictive to extremely open. Creative Commons uses various abbreviations and phrases that stand for types of licenses - types of sharing and distribution:
            </p>
            <ul>
            <li><b>CC:</b> Creative Commons</li> 
            <li><b>BY:</b> Attribution - giving credit to the person "by" whom the content was created</li> 
            <li><b>SA:</b> Share Alike - signifies that sharing by identical license terms is permitted </li>
            <li><b>ND:</b> No derivatives allowed (content cannot be remixed, tweaked, or built upon) </li>
            <li><b>NC:</b> Non-commercial </li>
            <li><b>Public Domain Mark:</b> Signifies no known copyright</li> 
            <li><b>CC0:</b> No rights reserved (copyright owner has opted out of imposing restrictions on content)</li> 
            </ul>
            <br/>            
            <p>Creative Commons licenses can take the following combinations, which is what a depositor sees on the page where metadata (descriptions) are entered. Via the drop-down menu, the depositor may select any of the following licenses (these are all described at "About the Licenses" on the Creative Commons site):
            </p> <ul>

            With this license you allow others to "remix, tweak, and build" on your deposited content, including for commercial uses, provided they attribute you as the original creator AND incorporate the same level of licensing (i.e., CC BY-SA) for the newly resulting creation. "All new works based on yours will carry the same license, so any derivatives will also allow commercial use."</li> 
            <li><b>Attribution-NoDerivs 3.0: CC BY-ND </b><br/>

            The depositor sets permissions during the upload process. Access permissions give the depositor of content the ability to control who can find, see, edit and download their content.  You have the option of setting both "Visibility" (who can see an item) and "Share With" (who can edit.)
            <ul>
            <li><b>Visibility</b> <br/>
            This setting will determine who can view your file and its associated metadata (description) in ScholarSphere. The default setting for visibility of your content is Open Access. The Open Access setting will allow your content to be discovered in Google and accessed by anyone. The visibility setting, Penn State, will allow only users who are logged into ScholarSphere (via WebAccess) to view the content. The third visibility setting is Private. Files that are marked Private are able to be viewed only by users and/or groups that have been given specific access in the "Share With" section. 
            Permissions in ScholarSphere are hierarchical. This means that you cannot set the visibility of a file to Open Access or Penn State and simultaneously try to restrict access to a single user. However, you may mark the visibility of a file as Private and then grant access to particular users and/or groups for that file in the "Share With" section. 
            </li> 
            <li><b>Share With</b> <br/>
            You may grant "View/Download" or "Edit" access for specific users and/or groups to files. Enter a valid Penn State Access Account Id, one at a time, select the access level for that user and click Add. 
            The list of groups in the drop-down marked "Select a group" is a list of User Managed Groups managed by Penn State's ITS department. You may select a specific group and assign an access level for a file within ScholarSphere - similar to adding user access levels. However, management of these groups and their membership is handled centrally at umg.its.psu.edu.
            </li> 
            <li><b>Permission Definitions</b><br/> 
            View/Download: This file (both its content and metadata) is accessible from within ScholarSphere. 
            Edit: This file (both its content and metadata) can be edited. You may grant this permission only to Penn State users and/or groups.

          <p>Social media icons are displayed in all file records in ScholarSphere, regardless of access permissions. You can use these social media applications to share your content (i.e., URLs for your files) with others. The visibility and access permissions you set for that content will apply for these additional ways of sharing your file. Persons without the appropriate access permissions will not be able to view the content.</p>

          <p>Metadata is information describing a resource or collection of resources contained within ScholarSphere. 
            <br/>Metadata allows users to discover your content through searching on a number of different aspects of it -- subject search, author/creator search, format search, etc. It also allows content contributors to track the content they or others have submitted, i.e. files related to a grant-funded project, or about a particular topic of interest. It also helps other researchers understand how they may use the digital materials.

       <i class="icon-chevron-right"></i></a>
       <div id="collapseMI2" class="accordion-body collapse">
          <p>Two ways: depositors enter metadata (title, keyword, creator, subject, rights information, description, etc.), and ScholarSphere automatically generates other information about the uploaded file (these are the "File Details," which describe dates uploaded or modified, file size, etc.).</p>

          <p>
            Yes. Depositors and those with edit permissions can use the following steps to edit and update metadata (description) at any time:
            
            <ol class="faq">
                <li>At the login button in the upper right-hand corner, click on the downward arrow for the drop-down menu and select "My Dashboard." "My Dashboard" is where you can edit metadata.</li>  
                <li>On "My Dashboard," find the title of file and click on it, or click on the thumbnail image beside it. This will take you to the metadata record for the file itself.</li> 
                <li>At the top of the metadata record, under "Actions," click on "Edit." </li>
                <li>The "Descriptions" tab will already be activated - this is where you can edit metadata for the selected file.</li>
            </ol>

          <p>The ScholarSphere repository is being built on the Hydra platform. The <a href="http://hydraproject.org/" target="_new">Hydra Project</a> is a collaborative, multi-institutional effort to develop repository systems using common, community-sourced components. Initiated in 2008, Hydra partners include Stanford, the University of Virginia, DuraSpace, Indiana University, Columbia University and others. Penn State formally joined the Hydra project in June 2012, and will host the annual HydraCamp â a hands-on development training workshop â in October 2012.
