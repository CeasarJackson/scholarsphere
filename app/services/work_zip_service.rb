# A Service to take the contents of a work and convert it into a zip file.
#  It will take the original_file from each file set attached to the work
#  This service will only include files the ability can read
#  The zip file name will be returned from the call method
#
# @example
#   work = GenericWork.find(id) # work with file sets attached
#
#   service = WorkZipService.new(work, current_ability)
#
#   zip_file_name = service.call
#

  # @param [User|Ability] ability        User|Ability who will have access to the zip
  # @param [String]       zip_directory  Location to store zip file on disk
